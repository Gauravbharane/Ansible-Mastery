#  LIST IN ANSIBLE
# ============================================================
# About list:
# A list is an ordered collection of items, where each item can be of any data type.
# Lists are commonly used in Ansible playbooks to store and manage sequences of data.
# Items in a list are accessed using their index, starting from 0.

# Syntax for a list:
# A list is an ordered collection of items.
# Example:
---
  - name: Example playbook for lists
    hosts: all
    vars: 
      my_list:
        - item1  #0       
        - item2   #1 
        # Nested list       
        - item3:       #2 
            - subitem1         
            - subitem2
        - item4:
            - subitem3
            - subitem4

    tasks:
      - name: Access subitem1
        debug:
          msg: "{{ my_list[2]['subitem1'] }}"
      
      - name: Print all items
        debug:
          msg: "{{ item }}"
        loop: "{{ my_list }}"
# Ansible provides several ways to work with lists, including accessing individual items, iterating over all items, and nesting lists within lists. 
# This example demonstrates how to access a specific item in a list and iterate over all items in a list using Ansible playbooks.
